我们APP功能精简直接，核心功能就是根据用户信息进行卦文测算，进入即根据用户信息卜卦测算并为用户保存测算结果。只有测算完成后生成和用户相关的卦文信息后才为用户进行卦文的展示和描述以及相关商品的展示，如果没有卦文就不会有相关信息数据的展示，所以我们没有多余的非基于用户信息的数据提供用户浏览。

Thank you for your feedback.

Regarding your proposed Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage issue, I think it is necessary to have a brief introduction to our app.

Our APP function is streamlined and straightforward. The core function calculates the Chinese character based on the user information and saves the Chinese character information for the user.Provide relevant text descriptions and related products to the user based on the calculated result information. If there is no calculate result of Chinese character, there will be no relevant information data。
Therefore, we do not have additional information for non-account-based user access.

I hope to reply as soon as possible! Thank you!
